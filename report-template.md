## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this analysis was to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict credit risk based on various financial data about borrowers. By accurately predicting credit risk, lenders can make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, managing risk exposure effectively. 
* The dataset includes financial information about borrowers, such as: loan status, loan size, interest rate, income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt. The objective is to predict the loan status of future borrowers, whether they will default on their loan or remain in good standing.
* The value_counts() method was used to understand the distributation of the target variable (loan status), indicating that the dataset is imbalanced. Additional technqiues like class weighting and oversampling should be utu
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Methods and Algorithms Used: `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `AdaBoostClassifier`, `ExtraTreesClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`, `SVC`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `XGBClassifier`, `LGBMClassifier`

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
